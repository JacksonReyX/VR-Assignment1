Part 1:
For part 1, I made a 3d cube, capsule, and box and gave them different colors and textures with different materials.

Part 2: 
In Part 2, I made a top down maze when you run through corridors with the 3d player controller. 
The top down veiw does not show the whole maze so the player has to run around to map out the maze and find its paths and secrets

Part 3:
In part 3, I loaded a 3d skybox in space and the player can walk around using the vr headset as well as interact with the objects in the scene

Bonus: 
For my Bonus I made the maze from part 2 traversable through the vr headset
